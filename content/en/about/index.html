        To me, painting is composing and interpreting reality by means of the conscious and the subconscious. The creative process of my abstract works involves a spontaneous phase where I paint free structures and then transform chaos into a balanced whole. I aim to create a piece of art that invites the viewer to ‘take a walk’ in all of the elements and sense the mood of the painting. My choice of colours are influenced by nature, but I also explore other tones of the palette to bring out bright and transparent aspects.

        The concept of my artwork is to relate to the beauty of the natural world that today implies an environment of transformation and possible breakdown.
