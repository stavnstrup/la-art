## Contact

Contact me on mobile phone or email if you are interested in buying an artwork on my site. The exhibited paintings are for sale directly or through a gallery, while some of them are sold to private collections. My studio is situated at my home address, and you are welcome to visit and see a painting by appointment.

### Art associations and companies

If you wish to have an exhibition at your art association or company, we will make a mutual agreement on the time, duration and minimum amount of art works that you want to buy (normally 8-10.000 DKK). I can put 20-25 paintings in different sizes at your disposal.
